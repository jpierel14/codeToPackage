Welcome to codetopackage
========================
This package was created to make it simpler to make your own installable
Python package. It accepts a folder containing working standalone code and
turns it into an installable package with a barebones documentation. This 
should also work if you have multiple python files that import each other,
and folders of data that are accessed by the code.
